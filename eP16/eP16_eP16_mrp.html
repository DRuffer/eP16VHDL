---------

GSR Component:
   The Global Set Reset (GSR) resource has been used to implement a global reset

        of the design. The reset signal used for GSR control is 'arst_c'.
        

     GSR Property:
   The design components with GSR property set to ENABLED will respond to global
        set reset while the components with GSR property set to DISABLED will
        not.
        

     Components with disabled GSR Property
-------------------------------------

     These components have the GSR property set to DISABLED. The components will
     not respond to the reset signal 'arst_c' via the GSR component.

     Type and number of components of the type: 
   DP16KB = 4

     Type and instance name of component: 
   DP16KB : ram_memory_0/ram_memory_0_3_0
   DP16KB : ram_memory_0/ram_memory_0_1_2
   DP16KB : ram_memory_0/ram_memory_0_0_3
   DP16KB : ram_memory_0/ram_memory_0_2_1

     Components with synchronous local reset also reset by asynchronous GSR
----------------------------------------------------------------------

     These components have the GSR property set to ENABLED and the local reset
     is synchronous. The components will respond to the synchronous local reset
     and to the unrelated asynchronous reset signal 'arst_c' via the GSR
     component.

     Type and number of components of the type: 
   Register = 9 

     Type and instance name of component:
